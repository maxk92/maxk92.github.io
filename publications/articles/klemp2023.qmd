## Abstract

Performance analysis in elite football aims at linking the performance of teams to outcomes. To this end, success indicators (SI) are modelled as a function of performance indicators (PI) using statistical techniques. The aggregation of data on a certain level, however, poses the risk of overlooking effects of contextual factors, which might affect the association between PI and SI. If a contextual factor affects an association in this way, the association is said to be non-collapsible across the respective contextual variable. We analyzed 862 segments from the 1st German Bundesliga and examined the association between running performance and goal scoring with respect to the scoreline. We showed that the effect of running performance on success varies for different levels of scoreline, therefore this association is non-collapsible across scoreline. This finding has important implications for match analysis research, stating the need to account for scoreline and consequently adopting a segmented approach to match analysis.
